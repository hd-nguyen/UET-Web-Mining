It was not 100% what I looked for but the Manager called me afterwards to say I'm a a good candidate etc and exactly what he is looking for and I got a good vibe so I continued. The Second Interview, called technical. However was not asked any coding questions or any hands on question... very weird., and quite low quality Third with HR. I was called to the next interview soon after finishing So I was surprised I didn't get an offer right away, since I answered all the questions. Reason being - they got the impression that I gave the impression that Im not looking for a hands on position. Which felt kind of unfair I also had a struggle with their way of counting experience.

But interviewers did not stick to this at all, all the interviewers asked everything. On the last round, instead of soft skills, he asked me on few OS concepts. I had mentioned that I have worked on OS topics in AUTOSAR for few months and I had a vast area of expertise other than OS. But interviewer had only worked on OS and did not know anything else. So he was expecting me to have gone through stack implementation and check the code till register level. First thing is that that’s too much expectation on someone who has worked on it only for few months compared to him who worked on only that for more than a decade, second thing is he was so arrogant and was not letting me explain anything. Arrogance was due to the fact that he is in NVIDIA, which was not at all expected. That’s so sad to see something like happening in NVIDIA. I think he did not select me because of his ego issues and arrogance. Anyway, I attended 4 technical rounds after which I did not get any response from HR too.

I have 11 years of experience, having worked at some of the best and most recognized companies, and I've gone through numerous job interviews throughout my career. Some experiences were positive, while others were less so, but I always thanked the interviewers and moved on—until this interview. My candidate experience was the worst I can describe, even traumatic. I was interviewed by two interviewers, one junior and one senior. They introduced themselves pleasantly at the beginning of the interview, and then it began: they interrupted me rudely almost every word I said, made faces, mocked, belittled, and dismissed me. Furthermore, the questions were irrelevant and unprofessional. Typically, interview questions follow a format like: \"Tell me about a situation where X occurred, what was the situation? What did you do?\" In this case, the interviewers presented a current situation and asked what I would do, but provided no context. I would elaborate more on what happened in the interview and how serious it was, but the page is too short to contain it. This was the first time I almost stopped an interview midway. I still haven’t received a response from them. The answer will likely be negative, but even if it’s not, there’s no chance I would want to work at a place represented by those individuals! I wish the interview had been recorded so it could be shared as a lesson on how not to conduct interviews. I’ve been interviewing for years myself.

      "I applied online. The process took 2 months.I interviewed at NVIDIA (Santa Clara, CA) in 10/24/2024",
      "The process took around 2 months, in which I had 2 interviews via teams over the span of two months, one with a project member and one with the project lead. Basic questions about my resume and fundamental architecture questions were asked. After that was the panel round where I interviewed with four of the team members. The first panel interview went well though when doing the technical question by hand, I messed up a lot, but still got the right answer. The second team member did not ask me many \"technical\" questions but mostly stuff on my resume, but asked me stuff I didn't work on. It felt weird when I said I did x,y,z that they asked me something tangential, that my impression from the rest of my interviews, they didn't even seem to care about. I said something correct, but with the wrong reasoning to that, but overall the rest of the technical questions I answered fine that had to do with my experience. Third interview was a complete mess. The interviewer did not define any of the problems completely. Imagine being asked to do the operation \"whats 5 and 6?\" multiple times and asking for clarification and getting \"whats 5 and 6 together?\" and having to guess each time whether its 11 or 30. I should've known this when I referenced a common operation in PyTorch/NumPy/Tensorflow, and he seemed to be clueless about the notation. Final interview was great but fundamentally had the same problems as all the other interviews. They asked me do I know \"tensor parallelism\" which my immediate response in my head is \"what a dumb name, you fundamentally have three tensors, an input, output and weight tensor, and only one of them is parallel.\" While I felt this was my strongest interview because at this point since I was more used to asking for definitions and taking shots if they refused define them. This interview also featured the work I was most closely working on the past two years, but it still felt like there was a bit of pulling teeth when talking to them. I have been working on these problems for a long time in the accelerator space, and thought even though this job was GPU based I'd be fine. The accelerator space seems to clearly define these terms better by talking about them in terms of stuff like \"fine-grained parallelism\" or \"coarse-grained parallelism\" (see tangram out of Stanford) referring to how close to the compute they are or \"weight stationary,\" \"output stationary,\" \"input stationary,\" or \"row stationary\" (see work by Joel Emer and Vivienne Sze) to define which part of the tensor is the one moving (though that's just the primary one, as secondary ones don't have a defined order, but there are notations to talk about complete movement) and additional work even has high level languages or representations to define these movements (see Maestro out of GATech). Coming from that space into this, feels like speaking a completely different language where every word sounds the same and has no reflection on their meaning. To be completely clear, I am willing to learn all these translations, words, or definitions, but asking to do this on the spot without preparation to me reads as insane. It feels bad that constantly throughout the panel I had to fight with translating loosely defined words, or ill-conceived problems that in order to answer, I'd have to fundamentally be completely reactive to. I don't believe any role would actually have me do this, that it would be sit down and understand the stuff before simulating it, but within this process all I was given was a mix of poorly formulated problems and definitions that only makes sense to the people asking it a lot of the time. I don't believe they actually tested my ability to do the job, and at best they tested if I'd be as good as them day 1 which seems unreasonable. I'd find it hard pressed for anyone to pass the same process I went through without additional information about the language, types of problems being asked, them more clearly defining problems, or some form of nepotism.",

      "Position: Quality & Performance Testing Engineer. I was selected by an NVIDIA employee for the interview process, where I passed the initial screening and then moved on to the second technical stage. After reviewing the requirements, I realized that I fully met them. The interview was initially planned to include four participants, but none of them were QA specialists. We had agreed on a convenient date and time for the interview, but a few days later, the HR coordinator asked to reschedule due to the absence of one of the participants. We rescheduled the interview, and two days before the new date, I received confirmation. However, on the day of the interview, it was postponed again for the same reason—the same participant was still unavailable. I found this odd: a large company like NVIDIA was unable to demonstrate flexibility and responsibility in organizing an interview that had been scheduled across different time zones. At that point, I asked if it was possible to proceed with the interview with three participants instead of four. The HR had already canceled the meeting but then reconsidered and asked to continue at the scheduled time. The interview itself lasted two hours. For about an hour, I detailed my experience, explaining what I had done and how. During that time, I didn’t receive a single question about the position. There was one technical question and an assignment to fix code generated by artificial intelligence. However, when they asked me to fix the code immediately, I declined, explaining that I could complete the task, but I would need more time. The developer insisted that using anti-patterns, which essentially turn the testing pyramid upside down by relying on minimal and even unnecessary unit test coverage, was normal practice and tried to convince me of this. In the end, I got the impression that they were looking for a DevOps + developer engineer who would also take on QA tasks but with a QA salary. By the way salary range was not mentioned and asked at all. Regardless, it was a useful experience. The next day, I received an offer from another company where the interview process was exactly aligned with my role. I can not say whether interview was difficult or easy. I can say it was not coincide with the role which described in vacancy requirements and responsibilities.",

      "I applied online. The process took 4 weeks.I interviewed at NVIDIA in 7/21/2024",
      "I recently interviewed for a 6-month fixed-term contract as an EMEA Payroll Specialist at Nvidia, and the experience was quite disappointing. The interview process spanned nearly three weeks, with the first interview on June 11 and the final stage on July 1. The final interview was particularly frustrating. It was scheduled at 8 PM UK time to accommodate the newly appointed payroll director in the USA. During the interview, the Director asked very broad and hypothetical questions, none of which pertained to my actual experience or qualifications. It felt like a complete waste of time, as there was no effort to understand my background or skills relevant to the role. To make matters worse, he had mentioned they would get back to me within a week with their decision. It's now been several weeks, and I have received no update whatsoever. This lack of communication is highly unprofessional, especially for a company as large and reputed as Nvidia. Additionally, they emphasized the urgency of filling this position, yet the entire process dragged on for far too long. This contradicts their claim of needing someone urgently. It also became apparent that their payroll process is surprisingly manual and reliant on spreadsheets, despite having Workday as their HCM. This lack of investment and care for payroll operations is shocking for a company of Nvidia's size. In my situation, I had recently been made redundant and was actively seeking employment. Fortunately, I was able to secure another more senior job, but had I waited for Nvidia's response that never came, I would have faced significant financial stress. Their failure to communicate could have had serious consequences for my livelihood, which is unacceptable. Overall, this was a disappointing and unprofessional experience, and it significantly lowered my perception of Nvidia as an employer.",

One common testing tool is the PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) mechanism, which generates a predetermined bit sequence that simulates real communication.

Question: Design a digital circuit that implements the following formula with an initial value of 2: X new = X [ 7 ] ⊕ X [ 6 ] X new​=X[7]⊕X[6] Next, design a test circuit that outputs two indications: prbs_ok: An output that will be 1 when the next bit matches the expected one, and 0 otherwise.

      "Concise Explanation and Question In verification, we build test environments to ensure that hardware will function correctly after production. One common testing tool is the PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) mechanism, which generates a predetermined bit sequence that simulates real communication. This mechanism allows the receiver to verify the correctness of the received bits based on previous bits without needing additional information from the transmitter, thus saving valuable resources on the chip. Question: Design a digital circuit that implements the following formula with an initial value of 2: X new = X [ 7 ] ⊕ X [ 6 ] X new​=X[7]⊕X[6] Next, design a test circuit that outputs two indications: prbs_ok: An output that will be 1 when the next bit matches the expected one, and 0 otherwise. Counter (counter): Increments by one each time an error in bit detection is identified."

The interviewer said that the interview would be theoretical but it wasn’t. They gave me two questions, each one we discussed deeply. I still don’t have an answer regarding the next interview but I don’t think I’ll get it. I was not on top of my game because of one course I took three years ago and also because I was told that the interview is theoretical, which it wasn’t. The interviewer insisted I get interviewed very soon even though I communicated that I have finals and that I need to refresh my knowledge of the course I took three years ago. Bad idea. I did not like the interviewer; he was pushy, and too strict. Also his questions were designed to trick which just took away my passion of working for them. For example, I would answer correctly at the first time and he wouldn’t tell me, but ask questions in a “are you sure?” manner. I also could explain with another physical and valid explanation but he would want very specific explanation in his mind (sometimes you can tackle a question more physically in different ways, or mathematically, etc). So that mostly what made the interview difficult. I do not think I’ll get a second interview but even if I did, I’m not sure I want this guy to be my boss, it doesn’t sound promising.",

And the response was from the recruitment coordinator, saying let's have a technical interview on 4th October, (no HR, no screening, etc) The tech interview was quite good, I felt that I made a good impression. We mostly talked about Apache Spark and its internals, with some questions about distributed systems. The next day, another recruiter reached out to me and asked when I was ready to make a system design home assessment, and after confirming that I was okay - they sent me the task with a 2-week time limit. I did my best to complete the task, which was a quite good solution and sent it after 10 days. A couple of days later, I got a standard message from the recruiter coordinator, saying \"Unfortunately, at this time, we decided to proceed our interview process with another candidate. It is a decision we didn't make easily because you are really a strong candidate with a wonderful personality.\" Mostly, my feedback is negative because of my pipe dream to work in a FANG-level company and because I've spent too much time dreaming that everything is going well during this interview process. Interestingly, the position is still open (end of November), and even it was reposted on Linkedin.",

      "I applied online. The process took 3 months.I interviewed at NVIDIA (Yerevan, Yerevan) in 11/25/2023",
      "I applied for the Senior Data Engineer position at the Yerevan Office on the 26th of July 2023 and got a response on the 21st of September, after 2 months (shocking). And the response was from the recruitment coordinator, saying let's have a technical interview on 4th October, (no HR, no screening, etc) The tech interview was quite good, I felt that I made a good impression. We mostly talked about Apache Spark and its internals, with some questions about distributed systems. The next day, another recruiter reached out to me and asked when I was ready to make a system design home assessment, and after confirming that I was okay - they sent me the task with a 2-week time limit. I did my best to complete the task, which was a quite good solution and sent it after 10 days. A couple of days later, I got a standard message from the recruiter coordinator, saying \"Unfortunately, at this time, we decided to proceed our interview process with another candidate. It is a decision we didn't make easily because you are really a strong candidate with a wonderful personality.\" Mostly, my feedback is negative because of my pipe dream to work in a FANG-level company and because I've spent too much time dreaming that everything is going well during this interview process. Interestingly, the position is still open (end of November), and even it was reposted on Linkedin.",
      "Which types of query optimization do I know in Spark, and how do they work internally? How to make a join with two big datasets, if the joining condition is not strict (expected to hear about product join and keep only relevant rows) Other in-depth questions about spark-streaming internals, and big data techs like kafka, zookeeper, etc."

      "I applied online. The process took 2 months.I interviewed at NVIDIA in 10/4/2023",
      "The interview process spanned over two months and comprised four rounds: two initial screening rounds, a panel interview involving five interviewers, and a final interview with a senior manager. It was quite engaging as it delved into a wide range of topics, including questions related to my resume, computer architecture, operating systems, and embedded systems. Proficiency in C++ and a strong understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) were essential. The OOP segment of the interview was particularly in-depth, with a lot of intriguing questions. During the panel interview, each of the five interviewers focused on a specific topic. Overall, it was a comprehensive and stimulating interview process.",

      "I applied through other source. The process took 3 months.I interviewed at NVIDIA in 9/15/2023",
      "I had a very negative experience with NVIDIA. I was told that 2 teams were interested in my resume and was offered the option to interview with both. A few days after interviewing with the first team I was told I was moving on to the offer stage, and they asked me whether I still wanted to interview with the other team, which I did (since I was interested in both teams). I asked if interviewing with the second team would impact my chances with the first team and I was told by the recruiter it wouldn't. Moving forward a few weeks, I went through the interview process with the second team, but didn't pass the on-site interview panel. When I asked for updates about the offer with the first team, I was then told that they wouldn't be giving me an offer after all. The recruiter was surprisingly unprofessional about it and very callous in their answers, despite the fact that I was stressed about it. The first time I realized something went wrong was when they just said: \"Please move forward with your other offers the team has decided to take the role a different direction\". I was really taken aback because a few days before I had been told that I was the top candidate for the position and that they were still interested in moving forward. When I asked for a reason, I was told that it was because I was interested in a hybrid role but they later decided (after interviewing me) that they preferred to have the position fully in office. So apparently they decided I wasn't a good fit, even without asking me if I was ok with a fully in-office role? I suspect this was a lie, because when I confirmed that I'd still be interested in an in-office position, then a few days later the story changed again. This whole ordeal put me in a difficult position, as I rejected other competing offers thinking I could rely on this one. In general, telling a candidate they are moving to the offer stage, but then actually rejecting them, is a very unprofessional move. I have been through many interview processes but this is the first time it happens to me. This recruiter communicated with me very badly and gave me a very negative view of the company.",

Rescheduled for a second time, interviewer was a delegate of the hiring manager, was over 10min late, and not given the appropriate background information. The delegate did allow the interview to extend beyond the scheduled time to makeup for the delay. Received feedback three days later that they would be pursuing other candidates. I did appreciate the prompt conclusion.",

Q: Give an example of a time when you had to balance multiple priorities, how did you prioritize? Q: How do you handle a situation when you have to say 'no' to a request?"

This is when I decided to leave the interview process. You should seriously consider just interviewing here to leverage their offer, against your current employer or against other offers. That's the only reason to interview here. I feel bad for people who have to work in this environment.",

After saying, \"Yes, I'm Positive\" a few times (and being right), he kept on doing it. So they try to inject fear into the interview process, which is lame.

This is when I decided to leave the interview process. You should seriously consider just interviewing here to leverage their offer, against your current employer or against other offers. That's the only reason to interview here. I feel bad for people who have to work in this environment.",
      "They asked easy JavaScript questions. The technical interviewer would try oddly hard to \"trip you up\", and ask if \"You're 100% sure\" with your answer, before rendering your code. After saying, \"Yes, I'm Positive\" a few times (and being right), he kept on doing it. So they try to inject fear into the interview process, which is lame. I've completed several technical interviews, even with FANG companies, over the past decade, and the technical interview with Nvidia was the most obnoxious experience from all of them. Get better at interviewing people."

      "The interview process was an absolute train wreck. After speaking with the hiring manager, I came to find out that the role description did not match the role they were trying to fill. This affected my ability to prepare for the interviews and to even determine if I was a good fit at all. I got to the final round after having completed 7 “virtual onsite” interviews, each 45 minutes long. None of the interviewers had came prepared with relevant questions.

I am not sure how the panel members were selected to conduct the interviews, but it was clear that there was significant miscommunication amongst those involved in this process - and frankly, a lack of care to even prepare at all. In all honesty, I am quite disappointed in my interview experience at NVIDIA. It is clear that although everyone is incredibly hard working and committed to their work, it comes at a great cost. I selected “No” under the question of getting an offer. The reality is that I never got a response, even after completing the final round of interviews.

      "After almost 10 weeks I withdrew my application. At that point I had had three technical interviews. I accepted an offer from another company. They took weeks after one interview to schedule the next. My application was bounced between at least four HR representatives. The interview process was not transparent, I did not know how many interviews I was to have nor what they would entail. There was one very inappropriate and unfortunate experience. I have a disability and requested accommodations during the interview process. I filled out accommodation paperwork online and was told my accommodation requests would be met.

The interview process was not transparent, I did not know how many interviews I was to have nor what they would entail. There was one very inappropriate and unfortunate experience.

Eventually I spoke to the hiring manager who after recognizing that my background was effectively what they were looking for, he started saying that Nvidia is very competitive and in a condescending way asked me if I was open for a lower position before even interviewing me. Maybe this was a one off but this is definitely not the way to represent Nvidia. Very disappointing :/",

Summary: Typically 4 rounds, Interview with director, manager, then team lead, followed by coding leet code style questions. This may be drastically different for you, however. I had another DevOps role in NVIDIA and I had leetcode questions right off the bat. Asked the recruiter for assistance and they provided no insight on who I would be interviewing or how technical the interview was going to be. The leetcode at the end was a huge surprise and in DevOps typically leetcode is rare because of the nature of the work we do. I was shocked to be asked some medium questions and one hard (4 total) during the FINAL round. This confused me and caught me off guard because most companies do leetcode first in the process.They really have no clue how to interview software candidates for DevOps and it clearly shows. Overall, I would not recommend this as the process took upwards of 2 months for one position, wasting time waiting a week or more for the recruiter to \"hear back from the team\" to move on to the next step.

They asked me to write the constraints for some cases for eg write followed by read on the same address. It looks like a important part of their interview process."

      "\"Wannabe Big Tech\" Pros - The brand name Cons I am writing this review from a combination of few different interview experiences at Nvidia (both mine and others that I know). Nvidia wants to be considered in the Big Tech league, hence tries to behave like them (talking, interviews etc). However once you go through the interview loop and talk to peers working at Nvidia you realize, there is a lot of \"empty vessel\" there. For people interested in autonomous driving, you are better off interviewing at one of the better companies like Cruise, Waymo etc. Specific to the interview - 1) Unstructured interviews. Fun fact - I was asked questions on the same topic in all of \"8\" rounds. Shows lack of preparation and experience in interviewing candidates. 2) Please learn how to interview senior engineers. You shouldn't be assigning junior engineers, ask in the box questions and expect memorized answers. 3) Lack of robust vision in autonomous driving. Highly demotivating managers (are they really managers ?)",

      "My Background: I worked in compiler frontend (Clang) during my thesis developing a compiler like tool for static analysis of C language. Basically a linter for C programming language. Hiring Manager Round: He worked in GPU compiler optimization team at NVIDIA. Talked about stuff he does related to compiler optimizations. Asked questions about compiler optimizations like loop optimizations and peephole optimizations since I knew he is from optimization team I prepared these stuff in advance. But I clearly told him that I have never worked in optimizations field. Note: Compiler optimization is compiler backend where you also need architecture related knowledge. First Round[Coding] : Q1: Print all the permutations of string? I told him to change the question since I didn’t revise backtracking for this interview. He was humble enough to change the question. Q2: Merge sort on linked list with detailed runtime analysis? I answered the question successfully but made mistake in analysing the runtime. I implemented the approach of dividing the linked list in two halves and merging the two halves and recursively applying quicksort I told him it is O(n^2) which was wrong. But even he didn’t knew that I made a mistake in analysis and he kept on suggesting a method to reduce it to O(nlogn) which was wrong. Q3: How to implement hashmap? Possible approaches in defining the hash function for mapping keys? Second round [Coding] : Q1: Find min element in a binary tree? Q2: C code to extract words from a sentence and copying it to 2d array where each row contains a word. The code was a little complex. There he was copying the strings by breaking the whole sentence and also memory manipulation with realloc was done to handle the case of insufficient memory if the allocated memory is less than allocated earlier. E.g: I/p: Nvidia is a cool organization. O/p: Nvidia is a cool organization Q3: There is a 3x3 matrix of storing apps like A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 You need to maintain top 9 apps in this matrix. How will you do it? Now he didn’t mention anything apart from this. I didn’t ask him any questions and moved forward with the solution which was a mistake. I said I will do it using priority queue. Then he said how priority queue will work so I explained him insertion and deletion of node in heap for 20 mins then he said ohh but it will not be maintaining the order right? I was like whattt. He said can you think of other data structures for this? Then again after thinking for 10 mins I said I will store it using linked list and map. Basically it is Implement LRU cache standard problem. Which I saw a day back but couldn’t think about it at the actual moment. I told him how I will implement it and he didn’t ask me to code it and this interview was done. Third Round [Design Skills]: Q1: How do you reduce the cache misses in case of multiplying of 2 very large matrices? I couldn’t answer it since I had no idea how cache will work in this case. Q2: Then he asked a long cryptic compiler related problem. It goes like this…. Lets say compiler A calls compiler B’s “invoke” module 15 times and during that it performs some steps where the percentage of time consumed is written alongside Initializing a compiler instance 15% Preprocessing 25% Syntax analysis 25% Optimizations 35% How will you minimize the time consumed? Now what do you get by this problem? Do I need to make 15% to 10%? What is the meaning of reducing the time? It took me 25 mins to clarify the problem from the interviewer. Basically he wanted to know like do we need to initialize the compiler instance for all 15 calls or do we need to perform preprocessing again and again or not? So after I finally understood the problem I answered all his questions successfully. I told him we can have an if check if the compiler is already initialized. We can pass the argument to the invoke function to take the compiler instance. We can store a map to store the preprocessor related data and can use flags to know if syntax analysis was done already or not then he asked followup like can we remove if conditions then I said like checking the map size and stuff. So basically I handled his questions well. Fourth round [Clang knowledge]: This was the most sensible interview. She asked me all the details about my project and how I approached the problem and what data structures and design patterns I used for it. So basically she was interested in the work and since I did my project really well I knew each and every stuff she asked me regarding it. Compiler Director Round [Cultural Fit]: He asked questions about my project and some things like why do you want to join this difficult and boring field. Basically after his demotivation I decided I don’t want to join this field. After a week"

      "Probably the worst HR/recruitment department I've dealt with in a long time. I was shocked to see this coming from such a large company. After the last interview in the process, I was told I would hear back in a few days. I followed up several times but was ghosted for ages. Two(!) months after the interview, I get a holding email. Nothing for nearly another month, then I get an automated rejection email with no feedback at all. You'd imagine when it's down to the last stage and the interviewer tells you they've only got a small handful of people, you'd get some feedback. If you're applying for a job at NVIDIA, don't do like me, make sure you keep your eyes peeled for other opportunities while they let you know the outcome.",
      "The right interview questions to ascertain whether you're a good fit for the team. I selected 'difficult' because they press you to talk about specific steps you would take in complicated scenarios, so it requires you to think like you're a member of the team already."

      "I only did the first interview. It was a zoom interview, so was possible to do it remotely. It was very technical. The zoom called was arranged by email with the Managing director. And the interviewer was Head of Engineering, despite probably more of the engineering stuff was listening the Zoom call.",
      "More of the questions were very technical about how Oscilloscopes work, it characteristics, and how to analyses signals. One of the questions was what makes an oscilloscope \"expensive\", so what differentiates a good oscilloscope from a not as powerful ones. Another was how in an Digital Oscilloscope would one detect if a prototype signal is working properly or no, what type of signal introduce so you can detect that the output it's correct."

El proceso comenzó con una entrevista técnica que se enfocó principalmente en preguntas sobre algoritmos y estructuras de datos. Me pidieron compartir pantalla para escribir código y resolver problemas en tiempo real, lo cual fue un desafío interesante pero también algo estresante. Me sorprendió un poco que no hubiera preguntas específicas sobre Machine Learning, dado que es mi área de especialización, pero entiendo que quizás no era el foco principal para este puesto. Después de la parte técnica, tuvimos una conversación más relajada sobre mis hobbies e intereses fuera del trabajo. Fue agradable tener la oportunidad de mostrar un poco más de mi personalidad y hablar sobre cómo mis pasatiempos han influido en mi desarrollo profesional. Sin embargo, sentí que esta parte fue un poco superficial y no estoy seguro de cuánto peso tuvo en la decisión final. Un punto a tener en cuenta es que toda la entrevista fue en inglés. Esto no fue un problema para mí, pero creo que es importante que los candidatos sepan de antemano que se espera un buen nivel de inglés para poder comunicarse efectivamente durante el proceso. Después de la entrevista, la espera fue un poco larga. Pasaron alrededor de dos semanas antes de recibir una respuesta, lo cual me mantuvo en un estado de incertidumbre. Entiendo que necesitan tiempo para evaluar a todos los candidatos, pero creo que podrían mejorar en su comunicación post-entrevista para mantener a los candidatos informados. En general, fue una experiencia que me permitió practicar mis habilidades de entrevista y obtener algunos insights sobre lo que esta empresa en particular busca en sus candidatos.

In the week leading up to the interview, I spent 1-2 hours every day researching the company and taking notes. The first interview was with the hiring manager – it was direct and we talked mostly about the role. About a week later, I was contacted to schedule a second phone interview with the team’s senior manager. The interview followed a similar format and was very conversational. I received an excellent offer about a week later. Two things helped me get this internship: 1. Lots of research of the company’s past, present and future, and 2. Maintaining a growth-focused discussion (I.e. how I will grow and how the team will grow).",

      "I applied online and the recruiter scheduled a 45 min phone interview for the following week with the hiring manager. Interviewer asked various questions regarding the logistics of benchmarking a given game, how certain graphics settings affect performance, and whether or not I would hypothetically certify a game's performance based on certain performance metrics. I emailed the recruiter a week later and was told they were not going forward with my application. Rating this interview negative soley because the recruiter gave me no feedback whatsoever, citing Nvidia's policy.",

      "Met these guys at a career fair, got a phone call not that long after that for a behavioral/resume questions. Next phone call was a technical interview, it sounded like you can get tailored questions to your language of your liking, and I went with Python since it's easy. TL;DR: Few weeks later, I was flown down to Santa Clara to do the interview, and was given 5 rounds of interviews. Range of ML questions, behavioral questions, Python questions (which I think stemmed from the fact I told them Python is my jam), CI/CD design questions. For the whole story for those interested: Round 1 was given by some PhD. Gave me some simple Python data structure wrangling exercises. While I can't say the questions specifically, it required deep knowledge of how Python dictionaries are built under the hood under specific versions (e.g. 3.6 vs 3.8). We never talked about Python 2. Solution consisted of using builtin functions (e.g. map, filter, sorted), lambdas, and a few for loops. He actually asked the same question that was asked on the second phone interview. Round 2 was given by another PhD. Asked me some tensor questions. Pretty much data cleaning/normalization across 3+ dimensions. I think the secret/trick to solving the question was to solve it using 1 dimension first, and apply it to higher dimensions. End solution was essentially 4 nested for loops, which was promptly followed up by a multi-core parallel question. Required knowledge of knowing when a mutex would be effective, when it wouldn't, and how to parallelize code. Round 3 was given by the hiring manager (lunch). He bought me lunch and we talked about my previous experience. He was especially interested in my Microsoft internships. Round 4 was probably the worst round. He was new to the team and had poorly defined questions. He asked about CI/CD design, and never seemed satisfied with my answers. As if he had difficulty phrasing his questions (I don't think english was his first language). Lots of awkward silences, so I took the opportunity to slam him with a bunch of questions to prevent him from asking me obscure CI/CD questions. e.g. Why don't you like the existing CI/CD system? What market do you think CI/CD poorly targets? What would you change about it? etc. And after that I sort of asked him about company culture/what's with the beef with Apple? He seemed happy at the end of it all. Round 5 was the most rushed round. He came in, gave me an API for some component web-like component and told me to implement some functionality given that API. It was supposed to mimic how things worked in very low level. E.g. when you read a file with system calls, you'll get interrupted a lot and you have to try again a lot. We ran out of time for this one, since I'm a slow coder and he came in late. He didn't care about syntax of my code, so I even used math notation for some of the code. At the end he told me he disliked Python LOL. Flew back. Took some finals in school, got an offer after I bombed a final. Life's good.",

So, we scheduled two more interviews with employees of my future team. The second one was with a Senior Solutions Architect which was supposed to work with me. He got deep in the technical part of my background. We went barely point by point in my CV discussing the algorithms and techniques that I used and why. He also was so close and kind. The third one had a role based in Business and Sales. He was responsible to talk with the client and see if it was suitable for the team. We discussed more my personality and experience with treating clients. On the other hand, he asked me if I was okay with traveling for work and visiting clients (not just code). After this interview, they sent me an e-mail telling my that I move forward to the last online interview. I fourth was with the National Principal Solution Architect. This one was hard, he asked me things about hardware, architecture, deep learning, machine learning, personality, and background. I had the feeling that all of them went really well. Just for how was the connection with all of them and also for their non-verbal language. They ended up rejecting me for my visa situation. I am from Barcelona, Spain and this position was in NYC.

      "Round 1 was a combination of HR and Technical. In this round, I was asked about myself and about my Project. The interviewer was all the time asking about my project during 20 min (because my project was related to NVIDIA), and in last 15 minutes, he asked me simple questions on C/C++. Question 1 You are given two Vectors of number, how will you get Dot product? [Dot product of vectors :)] Question 2: How will you allocate dynamic memory for two dimensional array 🙂 Question 3 : Do you Know ASM Language (I said very little). So he asked me to do Question 1 in ASM (I have told him basic logic that how can we do it in ASM) Now he asked me, if Numbers in Vectors are n=16 bit long then the resultant Number of bits? Round 2: 1. Difference between Macro and Function 🙂 [he required a deep knowledge of it, so I answered in terms of Compile time execution, run time execution, Stacks and Instruction pointer (Program Counter)] 2. Write a function to calculate Compound Interest with restriction. [I told him sorry sir I forget formula of it, so he gave me formula for compound interest, t = P.(1+(r/n)^nt] 3.You have a silver rod of 7 inches, now a person visit your home and ask for 1 inch of rod every day in a week. How much minimum number of cuts required in a Week? [Ans. Is in power of Two 1,2,4 (can you find why? Try ok)] Tip:- Questions Like this, always have ans in “Power of Two” 🙂 4. A program in CUDA C (Project). 5. How many number of Zero’s are there in 100!, and how will you calculate it? [Easy one: Divide by 5 again and again and add all them] so he asked me how I come to know, so I explained. Round 3: This round was totally based on my project and two aptitude question asked to me at last",

However, the recruiter informed me a very last minute change of schedule from 1 pm to 6 pm for my interview. But in the end, the hiring manager called me at 530pm just to surprise me. It was disappointing to know that the hiring manager could not even manage schedule well. Then during the interview, the hiring manager surprised me even more. She said I have your CV in front of me, so you do NOT need to walk me through your experience. She is not sincerely interested in me at the very beginning. She did NOT ask any specific case questions or tested my technical background. All the questions are unstructured. She asked \"how technical you are?\", \"do you prefer fast-paced or slow-paced environment?\" and \"why are you pursuing an MBA?\" It seems that she wants a CS engineer to work as a program manager, but she posted the JD to a top MBA program. I then asked 2 questions. First, how in depth of technical skills are you looking for and what tools you need the candidate to know? She replied, \"as much as possible\". That's it. I then asked how the company supports female working in tech and how is the culture there. She replied, \"I don't understand what you are asking. Oh, I think we have some female only workshops.\" The whole interview only lasted 16 mins without any meaningful exchange of information. No respect is shown.",

I had a good time during these interviews. I was asked to do some coding challenges, followed by computer architecture, linux, protocol questions. After these 2 phone interview, I was asked to appear onsite for a full blown interview loop. This loop included 6-7 rounds from 9:30am till 4pm. The first interviewer was late ( I have come to expect these things after interviewing in other places), then after 20 mins, the first interviewer was replaced. Nonetheless, I had positive experience talking with the interviewers. Some were tasked to test my coding skills, while a others were testing my operating system and computer architecture skills. The interview went on well (meaning no negative experience thus far). The negative experience came after the interview. I waited patiently for the recruiter to get back for a week. I also had an onsite in another big firm the following week and this firm was interested to move on with my candidacy. I politely asked the recruiter to let me know of the result as it had already been 10 days since onsite ( I also let them know that I have another offer in hand). No word from the recruiter. I was \"ghosted\". After 2 weeks, the second firm was started to strong arm me into signing the offer letter while I was still waiting on Nvidia. After nearly 20 days, the recruiter called me and informed me that the hiring manager was traveling and will not be back until the next week. This drama went on for another week and I somehow was able to hold off from signing with the second firm. The following week I had politely given an ultimatum to the recruiter that I would have to move on if I dont listen from them in the next couple of days. After this the recruiter got back and let me know that the HM was not \"very keen\" on moving forward. What? Not \"very keen\" ? I spent 1 full day at NVIDIA, and all I expected was either they wanted to move forward or not. \"Not keen\" was not something I was not expecting. I made up my mind to not reply to this recruiter and moved on. To Nvidia - When a candidate spends hours in an interview loop, the least the company can do is to let the candidate know of the result. The very least you can do is have a feedback link that works!

      "I applied online for a separate Software Engineer position. A week later I get an email from a recruiter saying that the hiring manager for a separate team saw my resume and would like to interview me. The interview lasted about 45 minutes long. He asked general OS and C++/C questions. I answered all of these questions correctly. Then he tells me great job and proceeds to speak about his team and the work that they do. He even asks me which location I would prefer to work. Although I didn't make it far in the interview process, he told me that the process for his team is generally this: Interview with hiring manager (himself) Interview with an engineer on his team (more detailed C/C++ questions, coding problem) Onsite The interview with the manager was fairly positive....it was the events that happened after that lead to my negative experience. I was told by the manager that I should hear back from him in a week. A week goes by and I email the recruiter asking what the status of my application was. I explained to them that I had a competing offer and I had a deadline. She tells me that she will speak with him and the team then get to me......then I never got a response. This same sequence of events happened for 5 weeks. It wasn't until the 5th week that I got an email from a separate recruiter saying that they will not be moving forward. By far the most unprofessional and aggravating interview experience I've ever had. Sucks too because I would have loved working for this company. I hope that your interview experience with NVIDA is much better than mine.",

It was technical with a mix of OS/ data structures knowledge and a reasonable coding problem. The second interview was with an engineering team member. Within the first few seconds I knew it would not go well because he had a VERY thick accent and was extremely difficult to understand over the phone. The interview focused mostly on debugging strategies/scenarios and some OS-related questions. It was an incredibly awkward interview as I had to ask him to repeat almost every one of his questions, sometimes multiple times and a couple of his questions I had to ultimately guess what he meant.

She did not respond to any emails and did not set up a proper time with me to meet with the hiring manager. Thus on the day of ... the hiring manager joined the interview 30-45min late and was condescending about being late. Not a good first impression. Right there and then I knew that is not a person I am willing to work for. Gave them that feedback and left ;)",

I have the impression that NVIDIA is an amazing company, probably one of the best places to work in the country right now if you want to be on the cutting edge of AI. The only suggestion I have (if the company is reading this) is to have someone on the interview team send a note with personalized feedback if NVIDIA is genuine about the wording in the rejection letter about encouraging me to apply for new openings. I have a rare skill set that is difficult to find on the market, and the team interviews seemed to go well. So I can imagine the company reaching out to me again at some point if there is an opening that is a better match, but I am not sure it that's just a boilerplate rejection letter (probably) or they genuinely want me to apply again.

The duration of interview in both the rooms was almost same, ranging from 35 to 40 minutes. After the interview, candidates had to wait in another room, which did not let the remaining candidates interact with them.The pattern of questions was, however, quite different, which is described below.",
      "Q: You have two diodes, how do you design AND & OR gate using those? - What do you understand by fan-out? * (Discussion of fan-out went on for at least 15-20 minutes. The questions that followed were based on the replies that I gave. It's quite similar to a viva you see!) - On what parameters does fan-out depend? Does it only depend on current? - Can you relate fan-out with input impedance/ capacitance? - Do you choose FET over BJT for the reason that it has higher input impedance or on basis of some other parameter and input impedance of FET just happens to be high? - Does fan-out depend on frequency? - If frequency is kept same and the input capacitance is varied, what effect would you see on the circuit?"

      "Written test was followed by an interview. Basic electronics, VLSI and Digital electronics questions were asked. The panel was of three people: Mr. M (Director) Mr. P (HR) Mr. B (Manager) Of these, M and P sat in one room (let's call it room-1) and interviewed half of the students while B (room-2) was in another room and interviewed the remaining half. The duration of interview in both the rooms was almost same, ranging from 35 to 40 minutes. After the interview, candidates had to wait in another room, which did not let the remaining candidates interact with them.The pattern of questions was, however, quite different, which is described below.",

The best part was there were typos throughout the email. NVIDIA - you obviously have great things going for you (exciting tech, stock price going up, etc.) but if you don't get your act together you're going to quickly turn off talent from new opportunities.

My issue with the process came after the in-person interview. No follow-up came for 2 weeks. I reached out to the Recruiter I spoke with and he said he would check-in with the team and get back to me. That was 3 months ago. I just now received an email that I was no longer in consideration. The best part was there were typos throughout the email. NVIDIA - you obviously have great things going for you (exciting tech, stock price going up, etc.) but if you don't get your act together you're going to quickly turn off talent from new opportunities. Granted, I was interviewing for a position that I wasn't fully qualified for. But assuming I was a great fit, I would have had to think very carefully about the culture and climate of employee-relations.",

Detect 11010 sequence with moore and mealy state machines. 3. Use of const ? What ll happen if you declare above 2 objects as const. 4. Explain NB assignment and blocking assignment. About event regions. 5. Fibonacci -- iterative solution and recursive solution. 6. Disadvantages of a recursive solution. 7. Output of this code fragment : reg a,b,c,d,w; assign w = a; initial begin a = 2; c=5; b<=c; a=5; end what is output of all registers. 8. Explain RISC pipeline. What is the problems. 9. Explain about uvm driver etc. ONSITE : round 1: Round Robin Arbiter Design round 2 : (1) Given a stack class implementation (LIFO) - there are 3 methods - push(), pop(), isempty(). Write a class using objects of given class to implement a FIFO. (2) Make best performance Implement the dist functionality in c++. Given a set of weights mimic to provide randomization skewed to the specification (Basically, write a function that would do something similar to a 'dist' in system verilog). round 3 : Given a divide by 3 state machine. Implement a divide by 5 statemachine. How many vectors are needed to verify it. So the circuit takes serial bit inputs and asserts if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5. round 4 : Circuits project. Basic pipeline architecture. Design a pipeline for a histogram processor. In every cycle we get an instruction (CLR, ADD INCR). Handle dependencies using bypass. round 5 : Given a producer and consumer. They are clocked with the same clock. Producer produces 80 writes for 100 clocks (no random). Consumer reads 8 times per 10 clocks. Find the FIFO depth. Write RTL and verify."

      "Panel was of 3 members and each candidate is interviewed for 40-50 min. First they asked about area of interest. When I answered Architecture, three of them asked basic questions on Cache, PIC, DMA, Fault Detection etc.. One of them asked if given a chance, which question in the paper would you attempt ? I corrected my mistake in fault detection"

If I was not fit for the role why did they keep me hanging for nearly a month without any intermediate update. If it takes so much time to make a decision, I doubt the skills of hiring team",

Then I get a call from the recruiter about 15-minutes into the 30-minute window I set aside saying the hiring manager was stuck in a meeting and has to reschedule. That's OK. I've been there. When we finally did talk, it was obvious she hadn't even looked at my resume. Again, I can deal with that, and I thought the conversation went fairly well, given that it ended with her telling me that the recruiter would be in touch to set up a next-step culture fit call with a team member. I was excited. But two days later I hear from the recruiter saying that they're going with other candidates. What a buzz kill that was. If I wasn't what the hiring manager was looking for, fine.

He started off by insulting thee way work at my current company (i work for a competitor). He also answered a phone call while i was answering a question, claiming that he answered it at that time since he was not able to receive the call on the day before. Yes, he thought that the best time to answer that call was while conducting an interview!! People are smart but some of them really need learn interview etiquette and basic courtesy.",

      "All other Interviewers were great. Unfortunately, the talent acquisition guy was what ruined the dish. His first question in my mail was requiring me to accept offer within 48 hours, otherwise he would move on next candidate. This was not only rude but also was a threat, which shocked me. He then asked for my salary expectation, then insisted a phone call, although I said I prefer email. In the phone call, he brought up the threat of \"... otherwise we will move on to next candidate\" twice. In the phone call, When pushed for expected salary, I asked him to give a range he said there is no range. Instead he drilled me for a number. The whole process with him is like a battle. I feel much more nervous and uncomfortable when talking to him. No interviewer has made me feel so uncomfortable. He continued to drill to my home address, asked its price, how much sqft, how many bathroom etc, just trying to low ballpark my needed salary in Bay Area. I think he was going too far. Also he asked me how my current company calculated the promotion bonus amount and I said I don't know, he said its \"dubious\" and he was \"confused\" since I'm supposed to know the equation based on which the bonus is calculated out. I was really offended because there is nothing wrong that I didn't care my current bonus formula. Overall, he has been aggressive and not based on trust or good faith when talking to me from the very beginning. I have such a great experience talking to all the interviewers as well as other HRs; I had such a bad experience talking to this unprofessional salary negotiator that I started to doubt if I like this company, if this company will treat me like he does, if the company's benefit system will be as aggressive and pushy as he does. If you look at glass door, recruiters is a top dissatisfaction of NVidia and I believe a change on the styles of recruiters like this guy would definitely be a low hang friction to boost NVidias overall score.",

Very strange but I was relieved that they got back to me finally! Did a whole day of interviews on -site and phone interview with a senior manager of the whole team. After an agonising 2 weeks of waiting, they got back me via phone and email saying I got the offer. I was super excited as I liked the job profile of the position immensely. The HR then called me to ask about what I was expecting and explained the benefits etc. After I week, I still had no offer letter or communication except the email before, and I tried to get in touch with the HR. They never picked up or replied to my emails. Finally after one more week, the HR got back to me saying the position was removed and like you can try applying to other positions in the company. Seriously, a very unfair move on their side. Making me attend interview one after the other, prolong the process for 2.5 months, give me the offer and take it back afterwards. Totally lost all my regards for the recruiting process and HR, wasting my time,their time and playing with my morale!! They should have atleast helped consider me for other positions within the company but they never did!",

The interviews were fine in general but we didn't seem to be a match. I don't get surprised by odd questions or behaviour, but interviewers tended to cut my answers off mid-sentence. They did not like me setting context for my answers to what seemed like theoretical situation MCQ list. The role requires soft skills and situations are not black or white.",

He went over my resume, and asked questions about my project. Asked me to explain some projects. Then asked what is virtual memory, whats a mutex, difference between a mutex and a spin lock. He asked some behavioural questions like- How important is communication? What are advantages of being a team [player versus working alone? if you were to pick a manager, what traits would you look for? If you were a manager, how would you pick engineers ( what traits etc). How important is marketing skill in an engineer? Overall -cordial, polite, to the point, and nice. Got through first round- Got email the next day, about second phone screen. Second phone screen was with an engineer. He was also polite, cordial. Introduced himself, explained about some background. He saw over my resume, and asked some resume based project. Then he asked me if i have a pen and a paper with me. I did, and he asked me to write a memcopy implementation in C. I fumbled a bit on this and goofed up the implementation. He asked me to optimize the code, and what would the max optimization would be possible in such a code? He also wanted the code to be cross platform across 32 bit as well as 64 bit.",

      "I applied through college or university. The process took 1 day.I interviewed at NVIDIA (Pune) in 9/21/2014",
      "Campus recruitment drive in our college (September 2014) was conducted by Nvidia Pune. The profile being offered was of QA developer, but package wise it was the best company till date! Criteria applied was of 65% and I was one of the fortunate few to clear that criteria by 0.95%! Procedure of recruitment was straight forward- initial MCQ offline test for screening out candidates. (Pro tip: Aptitude test, apart from quantitative, included technical questions of C,C++,Data structures, Operating Systems. Do not prepare ONLY quantitative, as it had minor weight-age.) Out of around 234 candidates, they selected 38 candidates for technical rounds(2) and HR round(1). Typically, core companies have long, extensive interviews and as expected, my first technical round was of around 1.5 hours! I was expected to write code on paper and made to dry run it while handling each and every single exceptional case for the problem statement given. For most of the 1.5 hours, I was scribbling code onto paper and the interviewer patiently encouraged me to write each and every step. There were times where I had panicked and written spaghetti code, but the interviewer was satisfied upon hearing my explanation of the code (so I got that going for me, which is nice). After appearing for this interview, I thought I'd probably be spared off the second round, but I was called half an hour later immediately for the second round. My second technical round was conducted by a very senior developer who was present during the company's presentation in the morning. I was a bit nervous, but fortunately, it was easy enough. Basic questions of Operating Systems were thrown rapid fire style, which I answered mostly to his satisfaction. A small puzzle regarding maps was asked, although I'm not sure if I gave a completely working solution to it. Fear of rejection was closing on to me after this interview was completed. By 7.30pm, the results for the technical interviews were declared and only 4 candidates were asked to proceed for the HR round! I smiled to hear my name included in these 4, but the smile pretty much vanished for the ten minutes I was being interviewed. HR was particularly a weak area for me, but I survived it decently, answering all questions with confidence in my tone. A short while later, the results were declared and I was officially into Nvidia! :) A point worth mentioning here: After declaration of the names of selected students, we were asked to give a thought as to accepting the job or not. The developers were right there to clear any of our doubts and they were more than willing to give us a few days time before we confirmed our approval. I don't know about the other companies, but I can pretty obviously see here how much importance Nvidia gives to its employees and their decisions.",

      "Campus recruitment drive in our college (September 2014) was conducted by Nvidia Pune. The profile being offered was of QA developer, but package wise it was the best company till date! Criteria applied was of 65% and I was one of the fortunate few to clear that criteria by 0.95%! Procedure of recruitment was straight forward- initial MCQ offline test for screening out candidates. (Pro tip: Aptitude test, apart from quantitative, included technical questions of C,C++,Data structures, Operating Systems. Do not prepare ONLY quantitative, as it had minor weight-age.) Out of around 234 candidates, they selected 38 candidates for technical rounds(2) and HR round(1). Typically, core companies have long, extensive interviews and as expected, my first technical round was of around 1.5 hours! I was expected to write code on paper and made to dry run it while handling each and every single exceptional case for the problem statement given. For most of the 1.5 hours, I was scribbling code onto paper and the interviewer patiently encouraged me to write each and every step. There were times where I had panicked and written spaghetti code, but the interviewer was satisfied upon hearing my explanation of the code (so I got that going for me, which is nice). After appearing for this interview, I thought I'd probably be spared off the second round, but I was called half an hour later immediately for the second round.

We were called to the Nvidia office in the morning at 9. In the begining, there was a written test, each student was given a different problem statement and we were expected to write a code on paper in C. They were basic pattern matching / generating problems. The code that we wrote was later used in the Tech Interview to question us. After the test, we had 2/3 Tech interview rounds, which also had some basic questions of C, OS, File Handling, Scheduling, Databases, Data Structures, etc. ( The questions were pretty simple as we were students from Third Year only....! ) It was a very pleasant experience. The selection procedure spanned till 5, but we were really taken care of. They offered us coffee and even food ( that too free of cost). The HR and his Dept. were extremely friendly.",

All the interviews started off with several personal questions (going over the resume and past experiences, what you're passionate about and what you're like as a person) before getting into the technical questions. The technical questions were all asked in increasing levels of difficulty. So if you answered the initial question off the bat, they would change something about the question to make it harder until you can't answer it anymore (or if you do, well done!) For the last interview, I had to email the answer to a technical question as complete code. The other interviews just required me to clearly explain the algorithm on the phone. They did ask the question \"Why do you want to work for Nvidia?\". I recommend having a clear answer in your head before the interview, be up to date about their recent developments and be really confident and show your passion. Because it's a phone interview, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have those key points listed on a post-it or something in front of you. It'll help keep you on track on why you want to get this job!",

About a week later made it for onsite interview. I interviewed with about 5 engineers including the engineering manager and an architect.

I answered all of the technical questions correctly. But then the manager asked me a simple question about the design. I at first didn't understand the question and didn't answer it correctly. This peeved the manager who re-asked the question --but this time in a very irritated tone. Even though I had answered his technical questions (some of which are better suited to a software engineering developing C++ than a DV engineering coding SystemVerilog) correctly I feel something interpersonal happened. Anyway, after a week of waiting I never did get a yes/no answer back from the company and had to email the HR person to find get the final answer. It's always better for the company to give an answer back, because if the company never responds yes/no it makes the company look very disorganized and unprofessional which I think is probably an aspect to the group I interviewed with and is also evident from my experience working with former Nvidia employees who are touted as the \"best and brightest\" from this organization.",

      "The HR contacted me via email seeing my LinkedIn profile. I had two phone interviews basically asking about my resume and experience. Few programming questions were also asked. Like explain an algorithm to show if a given set of strings is a subset of another set of strings. What is its O(n)? After passing the two phone interview, I was invited for onsite interview. The interview was really good. Interviewers were really kind and made me feel comfortable. The interview lasted for 5 hours. 6 people interviewed me(one was HR). Here are some of the interview questions : 1. a) Print each character is the reverse order. Eg : Input : \" I just finished my lunch\" Output : \" hcnul ym dehsinif tsuj I\" b) Reverse each word in the sentence . Output : \" lunch my finished just I\" 2. Reverse all the bits in 32bit int. 3. A question on merge sort. It was a little complicated involving two processor communication. One processor had a sorted list and the other also had a sorted list. Write a program to merge the list in a memory accessible to both the processors. (I know I am not clear on the explanation of the question, basically you will have to know how merge sort works ) 4. Why is branching a bad thing for a processor? How does it slow the process down. 5. Given that in a switch statement, there are very large number of cases(say 10000). How best can you improve the O(n)? What data structure can you implement and how. FYI, each case statement can be a function. (Switch case statement is also branching ...) 6. Implement a 3x3 averaging filter(not considering the center pixel) given an image,width and height. What is the minimum memory needed to perform this action.",

Quizzed me about the gaming industry and my knowledge of the company's products as the job required gaming and industry knowledge. Thought the interview went well first 2 rounds. Round 2, I was a little uncertain about the outcome as I had mixed feelings about the entire interview process and felt I only made connection with only 2 out of the 4 people who interviewed me in the second round. However, they called me back for the last round, so I thought, I guess it went ok. When I reached the last round, the vp seemed highly disinterested, asked me which role I was interviewing for (as there were several and that totally threw me off as he mentioned the titles of the roles that were open really quickly and asked me which one it was). After that, he directly told me I wasn't a good fit, and that's within 5 minutes of shaking hands with him. I was a little shaken by that comment, my jaw probably dropped, and I knew it was pointless to continue the interrogation. Not sure if that last round was necessary if he already made up his mind. They could have just called me and told me I was not a good fit, instead of requesting me to go into the interview - I had to request time off to go in for the interview too. Recruiter, the Sourcer, hiring manager and the other team members were really nice. Overall, took between 6-7 weeks from submission of resume through the last round.

      "Initially contacted by recruiter on a recommendation from a peer. Had an initial phone screen with the recruiter to confirm basic skill sets and experience. Nothing unusual in the questioning here. Went for one day of interviews and met six people including the hiring manager, the Director and three engineers. Engineers' questions tested knowledge of investigative skills, QA process, and management of bugs. The Director was concerned with how I would develop a much needed program from scratch including managing resources a testing plan, developing and training junior test engineers,some of who were in India. The hiring manager spend most of the time determining if I had the project management skills to develop the program they needed. He asked lots of project-related questions and communication-related questions. He was very thorough. The final person was the recruiter who went over things like benefits and the rest of the hiring process.",

      "Introduction I am currently working at Yahoo one of the top Internet companies in the world. I also had the chance to work at PayPal the dominant company in online payments. When I lost my job in 2008 I had more than 30 phone interviews and several onsite interviews. Just to mention few names, I interviewed with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, Symantec, nVidia, Linkedin and few more. As long as you are applying to a technical software position whether it is QA or development then forget about the silly most asked interview questions such as tell me about your strengths and weaknesses. In this short article I will only mention few basic points that a software engineer should be aware of before interviewing at companies like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, etc. Not only I interviewed at many computer software companies but also I participated in interviewing candidates who applied to our team so the advice is from the heart: Academic Strength This is one of the most important points if not the most important point. A company like Google or Microsoft test candidates in data structures and algorithms over the phone. When I interviewed with Google they shared a Google Doc with me and requested me to write code and debug it. They ask about key topics in data structures and algorithms such as hash tables and running time. Moral of the story, If you want to increase your chance to pass those interviews then you need to be very strong in coding, debugging and testing from an academic point of view. I doubt that work experience itself can save you if the interviewer asks you about some tricks in algorithm design. This needs allot of practice to master. Communication skills Software development is team based so you need to have the appropriate written and verbal communication skills. Moral of the story, if you are a nerd that is not enough, you need to interact with people. Personality If you have everything discussed earlier but hard to deal with people or fail to work within a team or have an attitude then good luck. Conclusion As you can see do not worry too much about what you should dress on the interview day. Those folks look for smart, hardworking and problem solvers. Believe me",

      "The interview process was pretty standard for a new graduate technical position. They were at a career fair at my school and I gave them my resume. They were the only company to actually give me a brief quiz while at the fair. I was somewhat lucky because I mentioned that I had been interested in digital layout and the guy I was talking to was a part of the layout team so my application was forwarded to the physical design team at NVIDIA. I received an email several weeks later for a 45 minute phone interview. The questions were mostly about my resume and a few straightforward questions about doing layout. Some of the questions included what were errors when running DRC, what is crosstalk, etc. The interview went pretty well, no questions that were too tricky. I had another phone interview about 2 weeks later and this was much more technical and he didn't ask anything about my resume. Some of the questions included making a frequency doubler, reversing a linked list, and inverter sizing. The interview was only supposed to take 45 minutes, but I was slow in answering the questions, but he didn't seem to mind and we ended up taking over an hour to do the interview. Finally I drove out to the campus for the onsite interview. The staff there was really friendly and gave me a free lunch in the cafeteria since I had gotten there half an hour early. There were I think 5 interviewers including an HR person. I don't really remember all of the questions, but they were all over the place from doing simple circuit design (4 NAND) to drawing out the layout of a MOSFET. I was somewhat nervous for the onsight interview and made some dumb mistakes that I realized afterward so I left feeling not very confident. Its been several weeks and they haven't gotten back to me so I'm not holding my breath at this point. The best advice I can give is to not give a knee jerk response to questions they ask and first work it out slowly.

      "Git an email from a recruiter that scheduled a phone interview. The interview itself was a bit strange. There were no questions about my previous exprperience. The interview started with general Yes/No questions see what areas I know and don't know (RTL, Syntheis, timing closer etc.. This info we fed to the computer and then we jumped to technical questions. Also it seems from the interviewer initial questions, he didn't read my reume prior o the interview. The quest werve basic: 1. Inverter from NAND gates (all NAND input shorten to ingle input or one NAND input uses as the inverter input while other connected to 1). 2. Questions about bit size results of adding and multiplying input and a more complex combinations of it 3. How to limit a random number generator to be in the range of x to y - rand_mod=rand%(y-x+1) + x",
      "No real difficul question. I assumed I d ok, though I ddn't te any feedback during te interview."

Then i had another interview and the interviewer was very nice and friendly. He gave me a brief description of his work at Nvidia for about 15 mins. Then he head on to my resume and asked a couple of questions regarding a graphics project that i had built. Then he asked me 2 problems and my interview was over.",

      "The interviewer was good. He explained me that there was requirement in the Automotive department of NVIDIA and they were looking for somebody with a good background of multimedia(image processing, computer vision, video processing etc) along with a bit of programming experience. He then went through my resume and asked me about the projects, he could understand (to check my ability to understand I guess). Then he asked some basic questions related to programming, like optimization factors in a filtering operation (what can be done it make the process faster). I discussed a few parameters which I felt were relevant. He asked me a few questions of similar type, not too difficult.e. On site was supposed to be a 4-5 long process. I was given the name of the first interviewer. He received me on time and took me to a conference room. He was a Software person, so he started with some basic C programming problems. They were like \"Find whats wrong in the code\" type. I am an average programmer, so it took me some time to understand the problems, but the interviewer was kind enough and gave me hints and was in general helpful, and I guess he realized I wasn't a very good programmer, he let me take my time to answer. I was able to answer the questions, but was a bit slow and unsure of myself. So, I didn't think it went so well. I was planning to make amends in the next round as I was better at multimedia concepts, embedded concepts etc. I was then taken to lunch by a Sr. Manager. He was very kind and we had a good casual chat while having lunch. After lunch I was greeted by a Sr. person, who also wanted to test my programming skills. So he first started with the concepts of Static and Volatile variables, which I answered. Then he asked me about a particular code and see if it will work or not. I told him that it will and explained why. It was half right and there was a condition when it might fail, which he explained to me. Then he asked me to write a proper program to find if a number is a factor of 2 or not. I took some time, but wrote the code. Overall, this one was also OK. I did manage to answer the questions, but was a bit slow on the coding part. The third interviewer came in. He also said he was going to test my CODING skills. I was a bit surprised as, on phone I was told, that it required basic understanding of programming, and the position was mostly related to multimedia and embedded!! Anyways, this one was the WORST. As mentioned the previous two interviewers were courteous and were understanding enough to realize that I was not professional with 5 years of experience, I was a new grad. This third guy came in, talked about my resume. Then went to the board, wrote a question, explained a bit and sat and said write the code. It was a very different type of question about memory mapping. I wasn't expecting and most of all, I hadn't dealt with such question before. I tried to understand the question, but the interviewer was not helping, he was more like smirking that I was not able to get it. When I asked him to please simplify and explain the question, he repeated the same thing. Anyways, he was not helpful. I somehow managed to write a pseudo code, which satisfied most of the conditions, but he was mad that i didn't write a proper code and that my idea was not Efficient for programming. I apologized and said that I hadn't worked on such a problem before,he kinda gave a condescending reply. I had realized that this was the final nail, i wasn't gonna make it. Then the HR came in, with some generic questions about my status n all. I asked him exactly WHICH position, I interviewed for, cos, I am not a programmer by education, so if I was being interviewed for a pure software position, I was obviously not the correct person. Also, I was made to understand over the phone interview that programming is somehow secondary for this position. He gave me the most stupid answer, that this a GENERIC interview. Now, if thats the case then whats the point in even having a Job positing, right? Just interview any one. Also, the HR had the name of the person who was SUPPOSED to interview me on PHONE, not the one who ACTUALLY interviewed me. I told him so, then he changed it.

Then i had a 2nd tele round with a senior from Santa Clara, where focus had been again on netlist structure & problems/solutions related to that area. Thereafter, i had been called for F2F round at bangalore. There i had 4 rounds, first 2 rounds were technical rounds, where problems related to DS/algorithms were asked. Then, after lunch, 3rd round was focused around puzzles. Finally 4th round was a technical discussion with manager. In this, we discussed, profile/work requirement & company discussion, also discussion around company requirement. Then he discussed about my candidature , my past work experience. Finally discussion ended with mutual discussion around requirements of each other. After that, HR told me that they will give an offer in a few days.

First phone interview was with the same manager, it was supposed to be 45 minutes but was very difficult and took an hour and a half, with one question alone taking about a half hour. I ended up doing four interviews in total, one at the job fair and then three phone interviews over four weeks. All took at least an hour, so when they say to schedule 45 minutes give yourself some additional time. The process with NVIDIA is very frustrating. I think I was only supposed to have 3 rounds but their intra-company communication isn't very good, and then it took over three weeks after the last interview for them to decline me. I was left wondering if it was the accidental fourth interview that cost me the job! They are notoriously rigorous in their selection process and you will feel it in the interview. If you get a question right they will press you until you screw up to test your limits. I think the interviews are best described as demoralizing, as they invariably will find your weaknesses. All things considered, I was very impressed and came away knowing that the level of talent at NVIDIA must be consistently high and getting an offer would provide a great sense of accomplishment.

Second and third round interview was on the same day with 1 hour interval, many low-level C programming problems, and bit operation: how to calculate 7*x without using plus and multiplication (using bit shift and subtraction); fourth interview was about my personal Operating System projects, mainly on process schedule, memory management. Knowing Offer about two weeks after the last round interview. Very good interviewer - easygoing engineers. Quite good company. I'm a tech fan of NVIDIA for more than 4 years!!!",

Design a CMOS and gate And some basic logic based questions The questions were pretty much basic level. I got through to the second round and have selected for phone interviews which I believe will consist of 3 rounds. I will update how it went. Cheers ATB",

After 15 mins, then three more people showed up in front of me. Total of 8 people group panel in front of you. I felt a little uncomfortable and the room gotten hotter as we proceed with the interview. Later it gotten harder to breath because it's just so small with too many people inside. I was bombarded with questions regarding to my job experience, skills, design process, past projects, software, etc... All the questions came at the same time from different people. It was very crazy, almost dis-organized in a way. Once the interview is done, the other seven people had left the room, I was immediately offered a job with a hourly rate. I was surprised at the time that this was a contractor job, not a full-time. Later I've found out that it's just the culture at NVIDIA that they don't hire full-time. They want to \"try\" you out first without any obligations. If you are \"good\" as you say you are... then after about a year or so, they will promote you to full-time employee with benefits. So I took the job as a full-time contractor, and the job started about a week after. For about a year after that day, I was without health benefits and stock options.

Submitted my resume at Siggraph job fair in the year of 2009 in the August (of course) 2. Three weeks later, got an email from the nice recruiter for an initial phone screening. 3. One week later, interviewed by an software operation manager, asked about my expertise, and was told that he would forward my resume to the dev tech team 4.

Asked mostly technical questions related to their own background. For about 3 of them, I didn't do well - partly because background mismatch... 7. Get the rejection one week after.

Easy to talk to and he kept me informed of the process. The hiring manager was also very nice and spunky. A fast talker, very eager. The rest of the management team was kinda just there to be there. The VP was sharp one. He actually asked questions to test you and your knowledge. By the end of the week I had an offer and I didn’t have to really negotiate my salary they just offered me a number I couldn’t say no to and I started right away.",

When I arrived, I soon discovered that I was not interviewing with the group I was told I would be, and instead was partnered with a device driver developer.
